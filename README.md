# SQL-lite-DataBase
This program includes two EditText fields: one for entering a message and another for entering a phone number. You can save the data entered into these fields to an SQL database using Android Studio. Additionally, there are two buttons that allow you to retrieve data from the database.
This program provides a user interface with two EditText fields. The first EditText is used to enter a message, 
while the second EditText is used to input a phone number. The data entered into these fields can be saved to an SQL database, ensuring its persistence. By implementing two buttons,
users can retrieve data from the database, enabling them to access previously saved messages and phone numbers. This functionality enhances the usability and convenience of the program.
